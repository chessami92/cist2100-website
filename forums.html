                <h2>Character development in FPS</h2>
                We're looking at focusing on creating a game where the user develops their own individual character in this online FPS.

                    How about about collecting achievements based on particular objectives giving special abilities?
                    Certain achievements would be locked out based on past decisions, making the user think carefully about each of their decisions.

                I want to create a game with many different landscapes. Any ideas on what would be interesting to see in game?

                    I think it would be interesting to see landscapes that change throughout the game but keep the same general shape.
                    The change could be due to time passing or some outside forces that are changing it unnaturally.
