            <h2>How to Get Involved</h2>
            <p>Starting as a developer on the site is quick and simple with a free trial.
            Click on the <a href="404.html">Sign Up</a> link and fill out the form to gain the developer role on the website.
            All new developers to the site receive 5 free forum postings with unlimited number of contributors.
            You will be asked for credit card information while signing up, but we will not charge your card until you have verified that you wish to continue to use the service.</p>
            <p>After confirming that you wish to continue to use the site, payment will be set for a monthly billing cycle.
            You may sign up for the least expensive service, but will be contacted through email if the number of contributors you attract is above the limit of your current service level.
            Please see the rates below for more information.
            We want to keep a productive business relationship, but you may cancel your subscription to the site at any time if you feel unsatisfied with the service.</p>
            <h2>Posting Limit</h2>
            <p>Some plans have a limit on the number of postings created every month.
            While contributors will not be denied the ability to respond to an existing post, you will be unable to make further posts without upgrading to the next tier or waiting for the next pay period.</p>
            <h2>Average Contributors</h2>
            <p>Each tier in the pricing model has an average number of contributors associated with it.
            While your contributors will not be blocked if your average number of contributors in a month's rises above your plan's specification, you will be notified that you will need to upgrade plans.
            You will be given one month's time to change your plan before we begin putting a limit on contributions.
            We make every attempt possible to remove spam from the website, and posts deemed to be legitimate spam will not count towards your average contributor limit.
            Please contact us directly with the contact information provided to you upon signing up if you wish to discuss pricing or believe that you should receive a rate exemption for a particular month.</p>
            <h2>Sponsored Postings</h2>
            <p>Some plans allow a certain number of sponsored postings every month.
            These postings will appear at the top of the browse forums for a short period of time and also have a chance to show up at the top of users' search results.
            You choose which posts should be treated as sponsored, though you may not change which post is sponsored after making a selection, only delete or remove sponsoring of a posting.</p>
            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>Since you are building the game, the <a href="404.html">Terms of Use</a> of the website that all users agree to is written to give you ownership of all ideas generated through your forum postings.
            Use of ideas from forum postings other than yours is not acceptable without explicit permission from the original post's developer.
            You may request access to use any ideas generated in any posts, which will send a notification to the post's developer, which they can approve, deny, or request clarification from.</p>
            <p>You are not required to pay any of your contributors, HOWEVER, please understand that these people are giving you their time and ideas.
            You are highly encouraged to give free copies of alpha, beta, or release versions of your game to your top contributors.
            This will benefit you in the end by attracting a regular crowd to help you create your games.</p>
            <h2>Rates</h2>
            <p>
                All rates are subject to change, but you will be notified at least 60 days in advance to any changes.
