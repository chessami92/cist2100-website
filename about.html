            <h2>What We're About</h2>
            <p>For far too long has video game development entirely rested on the views and assumptions of what the sole developer believes his large client base to like in their gameplay.
            There is no better approach in finding out what your clients wants to see in their gaming experience than to approach them directly with the matter.
            Interactive Game Studios eliminates this barrier between developers and gamers, aiming to bring the most fulfilling video game for both developer and gamer by enabling gamers to be a part of developers’ projects from the get go.
            This process benefits both sides overall; developers gain the feedback they need while gamers are able to contribute their gaming desires.
            This interaction creates a more successful game that more people want to purchase and play.</p>
            <p>Our business model is based off charging developers a small fee to post questions, open- or closed-ended, in our forums.
            The fee is based on how many contributors the developer normally attracts with a tiered pricing model.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, contributing, commenting, and voting is free for all users!</p>
            <h2>Company History</h2>
            <p>Video gaming history dates as far back as the 1940’s, though it was not popular until the 1970’s and 80’s.
            Video gaming has jumped through arcades, home computers, consoles, and now come with an expectation of high definition graphics.
            Throughout the years, game development has primarily come directly from the minds of the game developers, but gamers want their ideas to be heard before games are created.
            Interactive Game Studio founders, Josh DeWitt, Daniel Alvarez, Autumn Swanson, Anthony Colby, and Ryan Fritts, addressed this need for voice from the gamer community by starting an online forum in 2013 for developers and gamers to communicate.
            The forums were initially meant for reviewing and feedback on current game development, but later incorporated threads for possible game designs and completely new development ideas.
            This site came to be the start up and eventually lead its way into the founding of Interactive Game Studio.</p>
