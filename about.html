            <h2>What We're About</h2>
            <p>We want to make game development to be more interactive between game developers and the gamers from the beginning of the project.
            We believe that bringing developers and gamers closer together will create better games that more people want to play.
            Our business model is based off charging developers a small fee to post questions, open- or closed-ended, in our forums.
            The fee is based on how many contributors the developer normally attracts with a tiered pricing model.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, contributing, commenting, and voting is free for all users!</p>
